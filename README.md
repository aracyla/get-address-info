## *GetAddressInfo*

* getAddressInfo is a simple app created to localize IP or hostname geographically;

* It uses a simple geo-ip API;

* It is not that precise, since it uses simple geo-ip API(which uses ip tables that might be outdate or wrong);

* This simple project was made to get into node-js and js stuffs;
